# Number-Guessing-Game
 It is a number-guessing game written in Python. The basic idea is to have the computer produce a random number between 1 and 250 and then have the user try to guess it. If the user guesses correctly, they win! If not, the computer tells them whether their guess was too high or too low, and they get another chance. It is a simple and fun concept.
